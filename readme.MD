# RDF Graph Structuredness

Calculate the structuredness or coherence of a dataset as defined in Duan et al. paper "Apples and Oranges: A Comparison of RDF Benchmarks and Real RDF Datasets" [1]. The structuredness is measured in interval [0,1] with values close to 0 corresponding to low structuredness, and 1 corresponding to perfect structuredness. The paper concluded that synthetic datasets have high structurenes as compared to real datasets.
